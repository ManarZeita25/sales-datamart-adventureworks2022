# üìä Building a Sales Data Mart Using ETL (SSIS)

## üîç Overview
This project uses the **AdventureWorks2022** database to build a **Sales Data Mart** using **SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)**. The goal is to extract, transform, and load (ETL) online sales data into a star schema optimized for analytics and reporting.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- Visual Studio  
- SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)  
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)  
- Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD Type 1 & 2)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This Data Mart is focused on **online sales data** only.

## üöÄ Project Stages

1. **Source Selection**  
   Selected AdventureWorks2022 OLTP database as the primary source.

2. **Data Extraction**  
   Used SSIS to extract relevant tables and fields for online sales.

3. **Data Cleansing**  
   Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized data.

4. **Star Schema Design**  
   Designed a fact table with multiple dimension tables to support analytical queries.

5. **ETL Development**  
   Built and tested SSIS packages to perform ETL operations efficiently.

6. **Data Mart Population**  
   Loaded cleansed data into the final schema, enabling structured analysis.

### ‚≠ê Project Workflow

Meticulously crafted a star schema that forms the backbone of our data mart.  
This design includes:

- A **central Fact Table** (`FactSales`) that stores key performance indicators such as sales amount and quantity, along with foreign keys to dimension tables.
- Four **Dimension Tables**:
  - `DimProduct`: Contains product details like name, category, and subcategory.
  - `DimCustomer`: Holds customer information including name and geographic details.
  - `DimTerritory`: Stores regional sales data.
  - `DimDate`: A time dimension that enables flexible date-based analysis (day, month, quarter, year).

This structure enables efficient querying, simplified reporting, and supports historical trend analysis.
